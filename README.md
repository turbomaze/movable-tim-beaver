Movable Tim the Beaver
==================

For the MIT class of 2019's acceptance tube, we were instructed to fold an origami beaver and do something cool with it. I wanted to immortalize mine by bringing him to the web, so I photographed him from 9 different angles and strung up a virtual puppet. To move my Tim around, all you need to do is load `b.js` on any webpage and press `W`, `A`, `S`, and `D`.

Note: the demo includes a short hardcoded move sequence, but it's simple enough to remove this feature from `b.js` if you want to use the general functionality of this script in your own projects.
